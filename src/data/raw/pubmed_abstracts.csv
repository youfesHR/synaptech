39039196,HER2-targeted therapies beyond breast cancer - an update.,"The receptor tyrosine-kinase HER2 (also known as ErbB2) is a well-established therapeutic target in patients with breast or gastric cancer selected on the basis of HER2 overexpression on immunohistochemistry and/or ERBB2 amplification on in situ hybridization. With advances in cancer molecular profiling and increased implementation of precision medicine approaches into oncology practice, actionable HER2 alterations in solid tumours have expanded to include ERBB2 mutations in addition to traditional HER2 overexpression and ERBB2 amplification. These various HER2 alterations can be found in solid tumour types beyond breast and gastric cancer, although few HER2-targeted therapeutic options have been established for the other tumour types. Nevertheless, during the 5 years since our previous Review on this topic was published in this journal, obvious and fruitful progress in the development of HER2-targeted therapies has been made, including new disease indications, innovative drugs with diverse mechanisms of action and novel frameworks for approval by regulatory authorities. These advances have culminated in the recent histology-agnostic approval of the anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan for patients with HER2-overexpressing solid tumours. In this new Review, we provide an update on the current development landscape of HER2-targeted therapies beyond breast cancer, as well as anticipated future HER2-directed treatment strategies to overcome resistance and thereby improve efficacy and patient outcomes.",2024,Nature reviews.

39821040,HER2-Positive Breast Cancer Treatment and Resistance.,"HER2-positive (+) breast cancer is an aggressive disease with poor prognosis, a narrative that changed drastically with the advent and approval of trastuzumab, the first humanized monoclonal antibody targeting HER2. In addition to another monoclonal antibody, more classes of HER2-targeted agents, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and antibody-drug conjugates were developed in the years that followed. While these potent therapies have substantially improved the outcome of patients with HER2+ breast cancer, resistance has prevailed as a clinical challenge ever since the arrival of targeted agents. Efforts to develop new treatment regimens to treat/overcome resistance is futile without a primary understanding of the mechanistic underpinnings of resistance. Resistance could be attributed to mechanisms that are either specific to the tumor epithelial cells or those that emerge through changes in the tumor microenvironment. Reactivation of the HER receptor layer due to incomplete blockade of the HER receptor layer or due to alterations in the HER receptors is one of the major mechanisms. In other instances, resistance may occur due to deregulations in key downstream signaling such as the PI3K/AKT or RAS/MEK/ERK pathways or due to the emergence of compensatory pathways such as ER, other RTKs, or metabolic pathways. Potent new targeted agents and approaches to target key actionable drivers of resistance have already been identified, many of which are in early clinical development or under preclinical evaluation. Ongoing and future translational research will continue to uncover additional therapeutic vulnerabilities, as well as new targeted agents and approaches to treat and/or overcome anti-HER2 treatment resistance.",2025,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Jamunarani Veeraraghavan, Carmine De Angelis, Carolina Gutierrez",HER2 resistance
39243601,crVDAC3 alleviates ferroptosis by impeding HSPB1 ubiquitination and confers trastuzumab deruxtecan resistance in HER2-low breast cancer.,"With the wide application of trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), the survival of HER2-low breast cancer patients is dramatically improved. However, resistance to T-DXd still exists in a subset of patients, and the molecular mechanism remains unclear. An in vivo shRNA lentiviral library functional screening was performed to identify potential circular RNA (crRNA) that mediates T-DXd resistance. RNA pull-down, mass spectrometry, RNA immunoprecipitation, and co-immunoprecipitation assays were conducted to investigate the molecular mechanism. Ferroptosis was detected using C11-BODIPY, Liperfluo, FerroOrange staining, glutathione quantification, malondialdehyde quantification, and transmission electron microscopy. Molecular docking, virtual screening, and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models were used to validate therapeutic agents. VDAC3-derived crRNA (crVDAC3) ranked first in functional shRNA library screening. Knockdown of crVDAC3 increased the sensitivity of HER2-low breast cancer cells to T-DXd treatment. Further mechanistic research revealed that crVDAC3 specifically binds to HSPB1 protein and inhibits its ubiquitination degradation, leading to intracellular accumulation and increased levels of HSPB1 protein. Notably, suppression of crVDAC3 dramatically increases excessive ROS levels and labile iron pool accumulation. Inhibition of crVDAC3 induces ferroptosis in breast cancer cells by reducing HSPB1 expression, thereby mediating T-DXd resistance. Through virtual screening and experimental validation, we identified that paritaprevir could effectively bind to crVDAC3 and prevent its interaction with HSPB1 protein, thereby increasing ubiquitination degradation of HSPB1 protein to overcome T-DXd resistance. Finally, we validated the enhanced therapeutic efficacy of T-DXd by paritaprevir in a HER2-low PDX model. This finding reveals the molecular mechanisms underlying T-DXd resistance in HER2-low breast cancer. Our study provides a new strategy to overcome T-DXd resistance by inhibiting the interaction between crVDAC3 and HSPB1 protein.",2024,Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy,"Yutian Zou, Anli Yang, Bo Chen",HER2 resistance

38875362,HER2/PI3K/AKT pathway in HER2-positive breast cancer: A review.,"Breast cancer is currently the most commonly occurring cancer globally. Among breast cancer cases, the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer accounts for 15% to 20% and is a crucial focus in the treatment of breast cancer. Common HER2-targeted drugs approved for treating early and/or advanced breast cancer include trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which effectively improve patient prognosis. However, despite treatment, most patients with terminal HER2-positive breast cancer ultimately suffer death from the disease due to primary or acquired drug resistance. The prevalence of aberrantly activated the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling in HER2-positive breast cancer was already observed in previous studies. It is well known that p-AKT expression is linked to an unfavorable prognosis, and the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway, as the most common mutated pathway in breast cancer, plays a major role in the mechanism of drug resistance. Therefore, in the current review, we summarize the molecular alterations present in HER2-positive breast cancer, elucidate the relationships between HER2 overexpression and alterations in the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and the pathways of the alterations in breast cancer, and summarize the resistant mechanism of drugs targeting the HER2-AKT pathway, which will provide an adjunctive therapeutic rationale for subsequent resistance to directed therapy in the future.",2024,Medicine,"Linghui Pan, Jinling Li, Qi Xu",HER2 resistance
38986734,PI3K PROTAC overcomes the lapatinib resistance in PIK3CA-mutant HER2 positive breast cancer.,"Although anti-HER2 therapy has made significant strides in reducing metastasis and relapse in HER2-positive breast cancer, resistance to agents like trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and lapatinib frequently develops in patients undergoing treatment. Previous studies suggest that the hyperactivation of the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway by PIK3CA/PTEN gene mutations is implicated in HER2 resistance. In this study, we introduce a novel PI3K-p110α Proteolysis TAargeting Chimera (PROTAC) that effectively inhibits the proliferation of breast cancer cells by degrading PI3K-p110α. When tested in two lapatinib-resistant cell lines, JIMT1 and MDA-MB-453, both of which harbor PIK3CA mutations, the PI3K PROTAC notably reduced cell proliferation and induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest. Importantly, even at very low concentrations, PI3K PROTAC restored sensitivity to lapatinib. Furthermore, the efficacy of PI3K PROTAC surpassed that of Alpelisib, a selective PI3K-p110α kinase inhibitor in clinic. The superior performance of PI3K PROTAC was also confirmed in lapatinib-resistant breast cancer xenograft tumors and patient-derived breast cancer organoids (PDOs). In conclusion, this study reveals that the novel PI3K PROTAC we synthesized could serve as an effective agent to overcome lapatinib resistance.",2024,Cancer letters,"Hongyan Zhang, Longlong Zhang, Yuna He",HER2 resistance
32721042,Novel HER2-targeted therapies for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in approximately 20% of all breast cancers. Before the development of HER2-directed monoclonal antibodies, HER2-positive breast cancer was associated with a rather poor prognosis. With the advent of monoclonal HER2-targeting antibodies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) and antibody-drug conjugates (trastuzumab emtansine [T-DM1] and trastuzumab deruxtecan), clinical outcomes for HER2-positive breast cancer have dramatically changed, and a greater proportion of patients in the nonmetastatic setting are cured. However, in the metastatic setting, resistance to anti-HER2 treatments still remains a major therapeutic challenge, underscoring the importance of developing novel HER2-directed therapies. Over the last year, there has been a dramatic shift in the current treatment paradigms for HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, with recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals of trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201), neratinib, and tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab and capecitabine. The authors summarize recent phase 3 data with novel HER2-targeted therapies as well as phase 1 and 2 data with other novel HER2-targeting agents.",2020,Cancer,"Siddharth Kunte, Jame Abraham, Alberto J Montero",HER2 resistance
38788968,EGFR and HER2 hyper-activation mediates resistance to endocrine therapy and CDK4/6 inhibitors in ER+ breast cancer.,"In patients with ER + metastatic breast cancer (mBC), the first-line treatment involves the combination of endocrine therapy (ET) and CDK4/6 inhibitors (CDK4/6i). However, a significant group of patients experiences disease progression, emphasizing the urgent clinical need to identify novel anti-tumor therapies. We previously generated breast cancer cells resistant to the combination of fulvestrant (ER downregulator) and abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) from MCF7 and T47D (MCF7-FAR and T47D-FAR). RNA-seq-based Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed hyper-activation of EGFR, HER2, and AKT signaling in both MCF7-FAR and T47D-FAR. Modulating EGFR or ERBB2 expression through loss- and gain-of-function experiments altered tumor sensitivity to fulvestrant and abemaciclib in parental and FAR spheroids, affecting ERK and AKT/S6 pathways. Cetuximab treatment overcame tumor resistance to fulvestrant and abemaciclib in FAR and EGFR-overexpressing breast cancer spheroids and xenografts. Likewise, patient-derived organoids (PDOs) from individuals with ER + mBC, progressing on palbociclib, exhibited up-regulation of EGFR and HER2 pathways. In conclusion, our findings suggest that inhibiting EGFR and HER2 pathways might overcome resistance to ET + CDK4/6i in selected patients with ER + mBC.",2024,Cancer letters,"Stefania Belli, Daniela Esposito, Claudia M Ascione",HER2 resistance
37272756,Breast Cancer Mutations HER2V777L and PIK3CAH1047R Activate the p21-CDK4/6-Cyclin D1 Axis to Drive Tumorigenesis and Drug Resistance.,"In metastatic breast cancer, HER2-activating mutations frequently co-occur with mutations in PIK3CA, TP53, or CDH1. Of these co-occurring mutations, HER2 and PIK3CA are the most commonly comutated gene pair, with approximately 40% of HER2-mutated breast cancers also having activating mutations in PIK3CA. To study the effects of co-occurring HER2 and PIK3CA mutations, we generated genetically engineered mice with the HER2V777L; PIK3CAH1047R transgenes (HP mice) and studied the resulting breast cancers both in vivo as well as ex vivo using cancer organoids. HP breast cancers showed accelerated tumor formation in vivo and increased invasion and migration in in vitro assays. HP breast cancer cells were resistant to the pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor, neratinib, but were effectively treated with neratinib plus the HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan. Proteomic and RNA-seq analysis of HP breast cancers identified increased gene expression of cyclin D1 and p21WAF1/Cip1 and changes in cell-cycle markers. Combining neratinib with CDK4/6 inhibitors was another effective strategy for treating HP breast cancers, with neratinib plus palbociclib showing a statistically significant reduction in development of mouse HP tumors as compared to either drug alone. The efficacy of both the neratinib plus trastuzumab deruxtecan and neratinib plus palbociclib combinations was validated using a human breast cancer patient-derived xenograft with very similar HER2 and PIK3CA mutations to the HP mice. Further, these two drug combinations effectively treated spontaneous lung metastasis in syngeneic mice transplanted with HP breast cancer organoids. This study provides valuable preclinical data to support the ongoing phase 1 clinical trials of these drug combinations in breast cancer. In HER2-mutated breast cancer, PIK3CA mutation activates p21-CDK4/6-cyclin D1 signaling to drive resistance to HER2-targeted therapies, which can be overcome using CDK4/6 inhibitors.",2023,Cancer research,"Xiaoqing Cheng, Yirui Sun, Maureen Highkin",HER2 resistance
39164784,The DNA repair pathway as a therapeutic target to synergize with trastuzumab deruxtecan in HER2-targeted antibody-drug conjugate-resistant HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.,"Anti-HER2 therapies, including the HER2 antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) and trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), have led to improved survival outcomes in patients with HER2-overexpressing (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer. However, intrinsic or acquired resistance to anti-HER2-based therapies remains a clinical challenge in these patients, as there is no standard of care following disease progression. The purpose of this study was to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance to T-DM1 and T-DXd in HER2+ BC patients and preclinical models and identify targets whose inhibition enhances the antitumor activity of T-DXd in HER2-directed ADC-resistant HER2+ breast cancer in vitro and in vivo. Targeted DNA and whole transcriptome sequencing were performed in breast cancer patient tissue samples to investigate genetic aberrations that arose after anti-HER2 therapy. We generated T-DM1 and T-DXd-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cell lines. To elucidate their resistance mechanisms and to identify potential synergistic kinase targets for enhancing the efficacy of T-DXd, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization, droplet digital PCR, Western blotting, whole-genome sequencing, cDNA microarray, and synthetic lethal kinome RNA interference screening. In addition, cell viability, colony formation, and xenograft assays were used to determine the synergistic antitumor effect of T-DXd combinations. We found reduced HER2 expression in patients and amplified DNA repair-related genes in patients after anti-HER2 therapy. Reduced ERBB2 gene amplification in HER2-directed ADC-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cell lines was through DNA damage and epigenetic mechanisms. In HER2-directed ADC-resistant HER2+ breast cancer cell lines, our non-biased RNA interference screening identified the DNA repair pathway as a potential target within the canonical pathways to enhance the efficacy of T-DXd. We validated that the combination of T-DXd with ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related inhibitor, elimusertib, led to significant breast cancer cell death in vitro (P < 0.01) and in vivo (P < 0.01) compared to single agents. The DNA repair pathways contribute to HER2-directed ADC resistance. Our data justify exploring the combination treatment of T-DXd with DNA repair-targeting drugs to treat HER2-directed ADC-resistant HER2+ breast cancer in clinical trials.",2024,Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR,"Jangsoon Lee, Kumiko Kida, Jiwon Koh",HER2 resistance
38759648,Emerging treatments in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer: Keep raising the bar.,"Patients with human epidermal receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer are experiencing a consistent shift toward better survival across the years, thanks to tremendous advancements in treatment strategies. The consistent improvements of outcomes set a high bar for new drug development and the need to explore new ways to overcome resistance mechanisms. Emerging treatments in HER2-positive breast cancer aim to tackle the disease by acting on different targets, including not only HER2 (both at the extra- and intracellular level), but also HER3, PD-(L)1, CTLA4, NKG2A, AKT, PI3K, and, in triple-positive tumors, the estrogen receptors and the cyclin-dependent kinases 4/6.

40228127,SNX10 deficiency impairs sensitivity to anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates via altering HER2 trafficking in HER2-positive breast cancer.,"Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are a rapidly developing therapeutic approach in cancer treatment that has shown remarkable efficacy in breast cancer. Despite the promising efficacy of anti-HER2 ADCs, many patients are still experiencing disease progression under treatment. Here, by analyzing the transcriptome data from patient-derived organoid models, I-SPY2 trial, and resistant cell lines, we identified that SNX10 deficiency conferred anti-HER2 ADCs resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer. Low levels of SNX10 attenuated HER2 recycling and promoted HER2 trafficking into lysosomes. Furthermore, we found the underlying mechanism of SNX10 in HER2 traffic by regulating the endosomal RAB11A. We propose that SNX10 deficiency contributes to the inhibition of HER2 recycling as well as the decrease of cell-surface HER2 and causes anti-HER2 ADC resistance.",2025,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,"Yu-Fei Chen, Qing-Hua Zhang, Zhong-Wei Zhang",HER2 resistance

39500221,Unveiling the future of breast cancer therapy: Cutting-edge antibody-drug conjugate strategies and clinical outcomes.,"Breast cancer has become the most prevalent malignant tumor worldwide and remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality among women globally. The prognosis for patients with metastatic breast cancer remains poor, necessitating the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies to improve survival rates. In the era of precision medicine, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) have gained significant attention as a targeted therapeutic strategy in breast cancer treatment. ADCs, a relatively new treatment for breast cancer, deliver cytotoxic drugs (payloads), directly into the tumor space, turning chemotherapy into a targeted agent, which enables patients to experience significant improvements with manageable drug toxicity. For the treatment of breast cancer, there are three ADCs approved for breast cancer treatment: Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-Dxd) targeting HER-2, and Sacituzumab Govitecan (SG) targeting Trop-2. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that the benefits of ADC therapies extend beyond HER2-positive breast cancer toinclude hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and HER2-low expressing breast cancer. Notably, the DESTINY-Breast series of studies, particularly focusing on T-Dxd, encompass neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and multiple lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer. This marks the advent of a comprehensive ADC era in breast cancer treatment. This review summarizes the efficacy and adverse effects of ADC therapies that have completed or are currently undergoing phase I-III clinical trials. Additionally, it analyzes potential combination strategies to overcome ADC resistance, aiming to provide clinicians with a comprehensive clinical guide to the use of ADCs in breast cancer treatment.",2024,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)","Lu Sun, Xiaomeng Jia, Kainan Wang",HER2 resistance

The biological functions and mechanisms of delta-like 4 proteins (DLL4) in THP therapy resistance were investigated in vitro and in vivo using the bioinformatic analysis, multiplex immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, sphere formation assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation, etc. Furthermore, DLL4-targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cells were established to sensitize THP therapy. DLL4 was identified as a key target in THP neoadjuvant therapy resistance for HER2 Our study revealed novel functions of DLL4 in cell stemness and immune infiltration, including NET formation and T cell exclusion, which collectively contributed to THP neoadjuvant therapy resistance in HER2",2024,Journal for immunotherapy of cancer,"Jingrui Yan, Yongjie Xie, Ziyun Liu",HER2 resistance
39023171,Inactivated cGAS-STING Signaling Facilitates Endocrine Resistance by Forming a Positive Feedback Loop with AKT Kinase in ER+HER2- Breast Cancer.,"Endocrine-resistant ER+HER2- breast cancer (BC) is particularly aggressive and leads to poor clinical outcomes. Effective therapeutic strategies against endocrine-resistant BC remain elusive. Here, analysis of the RNA-sequencing data from ER+HER2- BC patients receiving neoadjuvant endocrine therapy and spatial transcriptomics analysis both show the downregulation of innate immune signaling sensing cytosolic DNA, which primarily occurs in endocrine-resistant BC cells, not immune cells. Indeed, compared with endocrine-sensitive BC cells, the activity of sensing cytosolic DNA through the cGAS-STING pathway is attenuated in endocrine-resistant BC cells. Screening of kinase inhibitor library show that this effect is mainly mediated by hyperactivation of AKT1 kinase, which binds to kinase domain of TBK1, preventing the formation of a trimeric complex TBK1/STING/IRF3. Notably, inactivation of cGAS-STING signaling forms a positive feedback loop with hyperactivated AKT1 to promote endocrine resistance, which is physiologically important and clinically relevant in patients with ER+HER2- BC. Blocking the positive feedback loop using the combination of an AKT1 inhibitor with a STING agonist results in the engagement of innate and adaptive immune signaling and impairs the growth of endocrine-resistant tumors in humanized mice models, providing a potential strategy for treating patients with endocrine-resistant BC.",2024,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)","Kai-Ming Zhang, De-Chang Zhao, Ze-Yu Li",HER2 resistance
39531335,MAP3K1 mutations confer tumor immune heterogeneity in hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative breast cancer.,"Treatment for hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HR+/HER2-) breast cancer, the most common type of breast cancer, has faced challenges such as endocrine therapy resistance and distant relapse. Immunotherapy has shown progress in treating triple-negative breast cancer, but immunological research on HR+/HER2- breast cancer is still in its early stages. Here, we performed a multi-omics analysis of a large cohort of patients with HR+/HER2- breast cancer (n = 351) and revealed that HR+/HER2- breast cancer possessed a highly heterogeneous tumor immune microenvironment. Notably, the immunological heterogeneity of HR+/HER2- breast cancer was related to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 1 (MAP3K1) mutation and we validated experimentally that a MAP3K1 mutation could attenuate CD8+ T cell-mediated antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, MAP3K1 mutation suppressed MHC-I-mediated tumor antigen presentation through promoting the degradation of antigen peptide transporter 1/2 (TAP1/2) mRNA, thereby driving tumor immune escape. In preclinical models, the postbiotic tyramine could reverse the MAP3K1 mutation-induced MHC-I reduction, thereby augmenting the efficacy of immunotherapy. Collectively, our study identified the vital biomarker driving the immunological heterogeneity of HR+/HER2- breast cancer and elucidated the underlying molecular mechanisms, which provided the promise of tyramine as what we believe to be a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy.",2024,The Journal of clinical investigation,"Yu-Wen Cai, Cui-Cui Liu, Yan-Wu Zhang",HER2 resistance
40299549,Kinesin-like protein KIFC2 stabilizes CDK4 to accelerate growth and confer resistance in HR+/HER2- breast cancer.,"Hormone receptor-positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer (HR+/HER2- BC) is the most common subtype, with a high risk of long-term recurrence and metastasis. Endocrine therapy (ET) combined with cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors is a standard treatment for advanced/metastatic HR+/HER2- BC, but resistance remains a major clinical challenge. We report that kinesin family member C2 (KIFC2) was amplified in approximately 50% of patients with HR+/HER2- BC, and its high expression was associated with poor disease outcome, increased tumor protein p53 (TP53) somatic mutation, and active pyrimidine metabolism. Functional assays revealed that depletion of KIFC2 suppressed growth and enhanced sensitivity of HR+/HER2- BC cells to tamoxifen and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Mechanistically, KIFC2 stabilized CDK4 by enhancing its interaction with ubiquitin-specific peptidase 9 X-linked (USP9X). Importantly, reexpression of CDK4 in KIFC2-depleted cells partially rescued the decreased growth and increased sensitivity to tamoxifen and CDK4/6 inhibitors caused by KIFC2 depletion. Clinically, high KIFC2 mRNA expression was negatively associated with the survival rate of patients with HR+/HER2- BC who received adjuvant ET alone or in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Collectively, these findings identify an important role for KIFC2 in HR+/HER2- BC growth and therapeutic resistance, and support its potential as a therapeutic target and predictive biomarker.",2025,The Journal of clinical investigation,"Shao-Ying Yang, Ming-Liang Jin, Lisa Andriani",HER2 resistance
24887180,Trastuzumab emtansine: mechanisms of action and drug resistance.,"Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate that is effective and generally well tolerated when administered as a single agent to treat advanced breast cancer. Efficacy has now been demonstrated in randomized trials as first line, second line, and later than the second line treatment of advanced breast cancer. T-DM1 is currently being evaluated as adjuvant treatment for early breast cancer. It has several mechanisms of action consisting of the anti-tumor effects of trastuzumab and those of DM1, a cytotoxic anti-microtubule agent released within thetarget cells upon degradation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-T-DM1 complex in lysosomes. The cytotoxic effect of T-DM1 likely varies depending on the intracellular concentration of DM1 accumulated in cancer cells, high intracellular levels resulting in rapid apoptosis, somewhat lower levels in impaired cellular trafficking and mitotic catastrophe, while the lowest levels lead to poor response to T-DM1. Primary resistance of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer to T-DM1 appears to be relatively infrequent, but most patients treated with T-DM1 develop acquired drug resistance. The mechanisms of resistance are incompletely understood, but mechanisms limiting the binding of trastuzumab to cancer cells may be involved. The cytotoxic effect of T-DM1 may be impaired by inefficient internalization or enhanced recycling of the HER2-T-DM1 complex in cancer cells, or impaired lysosomal degradation of trastuzumab or intracellular trafficking of HER2. The effect ofT-DM1 may also be compromised by multidrug resistance proteins that pump DM1 out of cancer cells. In this review we discuss the mechanism of action of T-DM1 and the key clinical results obtained with it, the combinations ofT-DM1 with other cytotoxic agents and anti-HER drugs, and the potential resistance mechanisms and the strategies to overcome resistance to T-DM1.",2014,Breast cancer research : BCR,"Mark Barok, Heikki Joensuu, Jorma Isola",HER2 resistance

34320193,HER2 Activation and Endocrine Treatment Resistance in HER2-negative Breast Cancer.,"The lethality of estrogen receptor alpha positive (ER+) breast cancer, which is often considered to have better prognosis than other subtypes, is defined by resistance to the standard of care endocrine treatment. Relapse and metastasis are inevitable in almost every patient whose cancer is resistant to endocrine treatment. Therefore, understanding the underlying causes of treatment resistance remains an important biological and clinical focus of research in this area. Growth factor receptor pathway activation, specifically HER2 activation, has been identified as 1 mechanism of endocrine treatment resistance across a range of experimental model systems. However, clinical trials conducted to test whether targeting HER2 benefits patients with endocrine treatment-resistant ER+ breast cancer have consistently and disappointingly shown mixed results. One reason for the failure of these clinical trials could be the complexity of crosstalk between ER, HER2, and other growth factor receptors and the fluidity of HER2 activation in these cells, which makes it challenging to identify stratifiers for this targeted intervention. In the absence of stratifiers that can be assayed at diagnosis to allow prospective tailoring of HER2 inhibition to the right patients, clinical trials will continue to disappoint. To understand stratifiers, it is important that the field invests in key understudied areas of research including characterization of the tumor secretome and receptor activation in response to endocrine treatment, and mapping the ER-HER2 growth factor network in the normal and developing mammary gland. Understanding these mechanisms further is critical to improving outcomes for the hard-to-treat endocrine treatment-resistant ER+ breast cancer cohort.",2021,Endocrinology,"Aloran Mazumder, Stephen Shiao, Svasti Haricharan",HER2 resistance
29631097,HER2-positive breast cancer: Current and new therapeutic strategies.,"Since the identification of the HER2 receptor amplification as an adverse prognostic factor that defined a special subtype of metastatic breast cancer, there has been a substantial improvement in survival of patients affected with this disease due to the development of anti-HER2 targeted therapies. The approval of trastuzumab and pertuzumab associated to a taxane in first line and subsequent treatment with the antibody-drug conjugate T-DM1 has certainly contributed to achieve these outcomes. The Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor lapatinib was also approved in the basis of an improvement in progression free survival, becoming another commonly used treatment in combination with capecitabine. Inevitably, despite these therapeutic advances most patients progress on therapy due to primary or acquired resistance or because of an incorrect HER2 positivity assessment. Hence, it is crucial to correctly categorize HER2 amplified tumors and define mechanisms of resistance to design effective new treatment approaches. In addition, identifying biomarkers of response or resistance permits to tailor the therapeutic options for each patient sparing them from unnecessary toxicity as well as improving their outcomes. The aim of this review is to examine new strategies in development to treat HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer referring to the mechanisms of action of new drugs and new combinations including results reported so far.",2018,"Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)","Santiago Escrivá-de-Romaní, Miriam Arumí, Meritxell Bellet",HER2 resistance
29282680,Predicting and Overcoming Chemotherapeutic Resistance in Breast Cancer.,"Our understanding of breast cancer and its therapeutic approach has improved greatly due to the advancement of molecular biology in recent years. Clinically, breast cancers are characterized into three basic types based on their immunohistochemical properties. They are triple-negative breast cancer, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR)-positive-HR positive breast cancer, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer. Even though these subtypes have been characterized, assessment of a breast cancer's receptor status is still widely used to determine whether or not a targeted therapy could be applied. Moreover, drug resistance is common in all breast cancer types despite the different treatment modalities applied. The development of resistance to different therapeutics is not mutually exclusive. It seems that tumor could be resistant to multiple treatment strategies, such as being both chemoresistant and monoclonal antibody resistant. However, the underlying mechanisms are complicated and need further investigation. In this chapter, we aim to provide a brief review of the different types of breast cancer and their respective treatment strategies. We also review the possible mechanisms of potential drug resistance associated with each treatment type. We believe that a better understanding of the drug resistance mechanisms can lead to a more effective and efficient therapeutic success.",2017,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Kyung-Hee Chun, Jong Hoon Park, Siting Fan",HER2 resistance
34158475,Interaction between HLA-G and NK cell receptor KIR2DL4 orchestrates HER2-positive breast cancer resistance to trastuzumab.,"Despite the successful use of the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) in the clinical treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer, the frequently occurring drug resistance remains to be overcome. The regulatory mechanisms of trastuzumab-elicited immune response in the tumor microenvironment remain largely uncharacterized. Here, we found that the nonclassical histocompatibility antigen HLA-G desensitizes breast cancer cells to trastuzumab by binding to the natural killer (NK) cell receptor KIR2DL4. Unless engaged by HLA-G, KIR2DL4 promotes antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and forms a regulatory circuit with the interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production pathway, in which IFN-γ upregulates KIR2DL4 via JAK2/STAT1 signaling, and then KIR2DL4 synergizes with the Fcγ receptor to increase IFN-γ secretion by NK cells. Trastuzumab treatment of neoplastic and NK cells leads to aberrant cytokine production characterized by excessive tumor growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IFN-γ, which subsequently reinforce HLA-G/KIR2DL4 signaling. In addition, TGF-β and IFN-γ impair the cytotoxicity of NK cells by upregulating PD-L1 on tumor cells and PD-1 on NK cells. Blockade of HLA-G/KIR2DL4 signaling improved the vulnerability of HER2-positive breast cancer to trastuzumab treatment in vivo. These findings provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying trastuzumab resistance and demonstrate the applicability of combined HLA-G and PD-L1/PD-1 targeting in the treatment of trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer.",2021,Signal transduction and targeted therapy,"Guoxu Zheng, Zhangyan Guo, Weimiao Li",HER2 resistance
30306401,HER2 in stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity of breast cancer.,"Breast cancer had been the first non-hematologic malignancy where sub-types based on molecular characterization had entered clinical practice. HER2 over-expression, due to either gene amplification or protein up-regulation, defines one of these sub-types and is clinically exploited by addition of HER2-targeted treatments to the regimens of treatment. Nevertheless, in many occasions HER2-positive cancers are resistant or become refractory to these therapies. Several mechanisms, such as activation of alternative pathways or loss of expression of the receptor in cancer cells, have been proposed as the cause of these therapeutic failures. Cancer stem cells (CSCs, alternatively called tumor-initiating cells) comprise a small percentage of the tumor cells, but are capable of reconstituting and propagating tumors due to their superior intrinsic capacity for regeneration, survival and resistance to therapies. CSCs possess circuits enabling epigenetic plasticity which endow them with the ability to alternate between epithelial and mesenchymal states. This paper will discuss the expression and regulation of HER2 in CSCs of the different sub-types of breast cancer and relationships of the receptor with both the circuits of stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal plasticity. Therapeutic repercussions of the relationship of HER2-initiated signaling with stemness networks will also be proposed.",2019,Clinical & translational oncology : official publication of the Federation of Spanish Oncology Societies and of the National Cancer Institute of Mexico,I A Voutsadakis,HER2 resistance
39826885,Challenges and prospects in HER2-positive breast cancer-targeted therapy.,"Breast cancer remains the most prevalent malignancy among women globally and ranks as the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in this demographic. Approximately 13 %-15 % of all breast cancer cases are classified as HER2-positive, a subtype associated with a particularly unfavorable prognosis. A large number of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer continue to face disease progression after receiving standardized treatment. Given these challenges, a thorough exploration into the mechanisms underlying drug resistance in HER2-targeted therapy is imperative. This review focuses on the factors related to drug resistance in HER2-targeted therapy, including tumor heterogeneity, antibody-binding efficacy, variations in the tumor microenvironment, and abnormalities in signal activation and transmission. Additionally, corresponding strategies to counteract these resistance mechanisms are discussed, to advance therapeutic efficacy and clinical benefits in the management of HER2-positive breast cancer.",2025,Critical reviews in oncology/hematology,"Xiyin Li, Xueying Zhang, Saige Yin",HER2 resistance
32005279,HER2 heterogeneity and resistance to anti-HER2 antibody-drug conjugates.,"There has been substantial interest in HER2 intratumoral heterogeneity as an explanation for the development of resistance to anti-HER2 therapies in breast cancer, particularly to trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). Through a literature-based approach, we discuss mechanisms of resistance to HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in breast cancer. We describe results from clinical studies reporting the effect of anti-HER2 strategies particularly ADCs and their mechanistic effect. We review biological findings underlying HER2 heterogeneity and its implication in the development of novel anti-HER2 drugs including new ADCs in clinical development like trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201). We suggest potential mechanisms to optimize these compounds and their future clinical implementation.",2020,Breast cancer research : BCR,"Alberto Ocaña, Eitan Amir, Atanasio Pandiella",HER2 resistance
31566722,Overcoming trastuzumab resistance in HER2-positive breast cancer using combination therapy.,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer (BC) comprises around 20-30% of all BC subtypes and is correlated with poor prognosis. For many years, trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody, has been used to inhibit the HER2 activity. Though, the main resistance to trastuzumab has challenged the use of this drug in the management of HER2-positive BC. Therefore, the determination of resistance mechanisms and the incorporation of new agents may lead to the development of a better blockade of the HER family receptor signaling. During the last few years, some therapeutic drugs have been developed for treating patients with trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BC that have more effective influences in the management of this condition. In this regard, the present study aimed at reviewing the mechanisms of trastuzumab resistance and the innovative therapies that have been investigated in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive BC subjects.",2020,Journal of cellular physiology,"Afshin Derakhshani, Zohreh Rezaei, Hossein Safarpour",HER2 resistance
29751334,Treatment of advanced HER2-positive breast cancer: 2018 and beyond.,"In the 1980s the importance of HER2 signalling to the aberrant behaviour of a subset of breast cancer cells was recognized for the first time and, consequently, a hitherto unknown subtype of breast cancer - HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer was identified. The development of the anti-HER2 class of drugs, first with trastuzumab, followed closely by lapatinib, pertuzumab, and T-DM1, has improved outcomes dramatically. Nevertheless, metastatic HER2+ breast cancer remains an incurable disease and new therapeutic options are needed. Additionally, the rapid changes in treatment standards 5 years ago have left unanswered numerous questions, including the ""real-life"" benefit of pertuzumab and T-DM1, since both the CLEOPATRA and EMILIA trials were conducted in populations that no longer exist in practice and, moreover, on the role of endocrine therapy in HER2+ disease. Furthermore, despite significant research efforts, including translational efforts and new imaging techniques, no predictive biomarkers have been clinically validated and therefore a more refined approach to treatment tailoring remains beyond our reach. Finally, a better understanding of resistance to currently existing anti-HER2 agents and of the role played by the microenvironment (e.g. immune system) and of interconnected signalling pathways (e.g. PI3K-mTOR-AKT) is at the core of clinical trials exploring new drugs and new regimens. These include the combination of anti-HER2 agents and anti-PD-1/PDL-1, PI3K inhibitors and CDK 4/6 inhibitors, as well as a host of new panHER inhibitors, drug antibody conjugates and anti-HER antibodies, which may, in coming years further push the boundaries of what we can do for our patients.",2018,Cancer treatment reviews,"Noam Pondé, Mariana Brandão, Georges El-Hachem",HER2 resistance
24968823,P95 HER2 fragments and breast cancer outcome.,"HER2 is a 185-kDa transmembrane oncoprotein encoded by the HER2 gene. It is located on chromosome 17q21 and is overexpressed in approximately 15% of invasive breast cancers. In addition, it is a poor prognostic factor for survival and disease progression. Approximately 30% of HER2-positive tumors also express a series of carboxy-terminal HER2 fragments known as p95HER2, in addition to the full-length HER receptor. Previous studies have found that p95HER2 represents an independent prognostic marker in patients with HER2-positive disease. Moreover, p95HER2 status might be a decisive factor when choosing between different therapies because p95HER2 fragment-positive tumors are resistant to trastuzumab but respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib, as do p95HER2-negative tumors. p95HER2 fragments arise through at least two different mechanisms: proteolytic shedding of the full-length p185HER2 receptor extracellular domain and translation of HER2 mRNA from internal initiation codons. The present review is based primarily on recent studies suggesting p95HER2 constitutes a new surrogate marker for an aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer subtype with distinct clinical and biological features.",2014,Expert review of anticancer therapy,"Deniz Tural, Emre Akar, Hasan Mutlu",HER2 resistance
